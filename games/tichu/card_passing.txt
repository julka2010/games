The aim of card_pass.py is to help determine card passing strategy after the cards have been dealt, assuming no (Grand) Tichu.

First job is to determine which cards to send (including to your partner).

Idea No1:
  +  count which cards sent breaks the least combinations

Points to consider:
  +  long row is worth more than a pair
  +  Ace is worth more than a pair of 2s
  +  Drake, Dog are ignored
  +  Mah Jongg will not be sent


Idea No2:
  +  send cards from other players randomly, learn which cards would've broken the least combinations

Points to consider:
  +  needs writing a learning AI

Idea No3:
  +  download play logs and read hands and cards passed


Second job is to determine which card to send where.

Idea No1:
  +  you usually want to send highest of the three for the partner

Idea No2:
  +  you want enemy to have as little combinations as possible

Points to consider:
  +  Points from Idea No1 on determining cards sent

Idea No3:
  +  assume players can play better than I write code, and count combinations with the cards got without them sending any (each "enemy" has +3 cards as their partner got the card they didn't send)

Idea No4:
  +  define passing strategies in code
  +  test each passing strategy for all picking strategies for all hands generated
  +  count combinations
  +  report
